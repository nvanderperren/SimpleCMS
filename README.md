# SimpleCMS
Project for course Native Apps II: iOS (University College Ghent)

This app uses [Realm](https://realm.io/docs/swift/latest/) as databaseservice. To use this code:
* Install [Cocoapods](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html)
* go to the root of your project and execute  `pod install` in the command line.
* all necessary files will be installed

Datamodels are based on the [data profiles](https://www.projectcest.be/wiki/Publicatie:PACKED_Dataprofielen) made by [PACKED vzw](https://www.packed.be)

Terms are based on vocabularies that were "made" for several projects, like [Beeldbank Kusterfgoed](https://www.beeldbankkusterfgoed.be/) and [MEDEA](https://www.vondsten.be/). Monument terms originate from [the wiki of Open Street Map](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/NL:Kaarteigenschappen#Bouwwerken)

SimpleCMS is based on an unfinished idea of PACKED vzw
